        <p class="intro">This Privacy Policy describes how bl0btoshii (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;) handles information in connection with the animated short-form video content (the &ldquo;Content&rdquo;) we publish on third-party social media platforms, including but not limited to TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram (collectively, the &ldquo;Platforms&rdquo;).</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Platform Analytics</h2>

        <h3>3.1 What Platform Analytics We Access</h3>
        <p>The Platforms on which we publish Content provide us with <strong>aggregated, anonymized analytics data</strong> through their built-in creator tools and APIs. This data is collected by the Platforms themselves &mdash; not by us &mdash; and is made available to us as a content creator. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>View counts</strong>: Total number of views on our videos</li>
            <li><strong>Engagement metrics</strong>: Number of likes, comments, shares, and saves (aggregated)</li>
            <li><strong>Audience demographics</strong>: Aggregated, anonymized data such as general age ranges, gender distribution, and geographic regions of our audience (provided by the Platforms in aggregate form only)</li>
            <li><strong>Watch time</strong>: Average and total watch time on our videos (aggregated)</li>
            <li><strong>Completion rate</strong>: Percentage of viewers who watch our videos to completion (aggregated)</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic sources</strong>: How viewers found our Content (e.g., search, For You page, direct) (aggregated)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 How We Use Platform Analytics</h3>
        <p>We use the aggregated analytics data described above solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To understand which Content resonates with our audience</li>
            <li>To improve the quality and relevance of future Content</li>
            <li>To make internal content strategy decisions (e.g., which characters or topics to feature)</li>
            <li>To generate internal performance reports</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Important Distinction</h3>
        <p>The analytics data we access is <strong>collected and controlled by the Platforms, not by us</strong>. We access only what the Platforms provide to content creators through their standard creator dashboards and APIs. We cannot identify individual users from this aggregated data.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Platforms</h2>
        <p>Our Content is published on third-party Platforms, each of which has its own privacy policy governing how they collect, use, and share your personal information. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of the Platforms you use:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>We are not responsible for the privacy practices, data collection, or data processing of any third-party Platform. Any personal information you provide to these Platforms (such as your account information, comments, likes, or messages) is subject to their privacy policies, not ours.</p>

            <li>Your comment, username, and profile picture may be publicly visible to other users of that Platform</li>

        <h3>6.3 Platform Responsibilities</h3>

        <p>For our internal operations (such as API credentials and analytics data), we employ reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures, including:</p>
        <ul>
